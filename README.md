# angular-datepicker

This is an angluar-cli project to show an 'input + datepicker' component based on NgBootstrap DatePicker.

The component allows date selection with a calendar popup and form binding (implementing ControlValueAccesor interface).
Instead of using NgbDateStruct in the model (as NgBootsrap does), it allows the usage of a 'flat' string.
This facilitates the processing of data with JSON from a server
